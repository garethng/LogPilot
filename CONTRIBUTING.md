# Contributing Guide for Python Library

## Introduction

Thank you for your interest in contributing to our Python library! We appreciate your effort and to make the process as effective as possible, we've put together the following guidelines.

## Getting Started

### Setting up the Development Environment

1. **Fork the Repository**: Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account. This allows you to freely experiment with your changes.

2. **Clone the Repository**: Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the `git clone` command.

3. **Set up a Python Environment**: It's recommended to create a virtual environment using tools like `venv` or `conda`. This isolates your project and its dependencies from other projects.

4. **Install Dependencies**: Install the required packages for the library using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

5. **Create a New Branch**: Create a new branch for your changes. This keeps your changes separate and makes it easier for you to submit a pull request.

### Understanding the Codebase

Take some time to understand the structure of the codebase. Here's a brief overview:

- `src/`: This is where the main source code of the library resides.
- `tests/`: This contains unit tests for the library.
- `docs/`: This contains the documentation for the library.

## Contributing

### Ways to Contribute

There are many ways you can contribute:

- **Bug Fixes**: If you find a bug in the library, feel free to fix it and submit a pull request.
- **New Features**: If you have a new feature in mind, discuss it in the issues section before starting work on it.
- **Improving Documentation**: Good documentation is key to a great library. If you find anything lacking or unclear in the documentation, your contributions are welcome.
- **Writing Tests**: More tests make the library more robust. You can contribute by writing more unit tests.

### Coding Conventions

We follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python code. Make sure your changes adhere to this style guide.

### Testing

Before submitting your changes, ensure that all the unit tests pass. You can run the tests using the `pytest` command. If you're adding new functionality, write appropriate tests for it.

### Submitting a Pull Request

Once you've made your changes, commit them to your branch and push them to your forked repository. From there, you can submit a pull request to the main repository. Include a descriptive message explaining your changes.

## Conclusion

We appreciate all our contributors and are always available to help you understand the codebase and process. If you have any questions, please feel free to ask.

Happy contributing!
